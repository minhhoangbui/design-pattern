# Decorator Design Pattern
This pattern targets at providing several new features or functionality 
to a function or a class without interfering with the old subject. This 
pattern will inherit the old class and overwrite the old methods or 
write and new one.

- Better inheritance.
- Allow extended functionality
- Protect existing implementation.
