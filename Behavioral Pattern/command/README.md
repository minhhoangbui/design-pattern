# Command Design Pattern
This pattern encapsulates the calling of an method as an object. This helps to expand 
the set of an object without interfering with the original codes.

The benefits of this pattern:
- Fully decouples the execution from the implementation.
- Allows for less fragile implementation
- Supports undo operation
- Supports logging and auditing operations.
